# Geocortex Menu Components

JavaScript library to hide or show menu items and/or toolbar components within the Geocortex Viewer for HTML5. This library requires that the components being removed exist within the site. Components are not dynamically added only temporarily hidden.

Hide and Show the following items in Geocortex Sites:

* I Want To... Menu items
* Results Menu items
* Compact Toolbar tool items
* Full Toolbar tabs, groups, and tool items

**Requirements**

Geocortex Essentials 4.4.3 and Geocortex Viewer for HTML5 2.5.2 and tested on beta versions of Geocortex Essentials 4.5 and Geocortex Viewer for HTML5 2.6. It may run on earlier versions of Geocortex Essentials and Geocortex Viewer for HTML5 but has not been tested.

## Installation

This JavaScript module can be installed in either the Geocortex HTML5 Viewer or within a specific site's viewer.

**Geocortex HTML5 Viewer Installation** - Available to all Geocortex sites.

1. Locate your Geocortex HTML5 directory, typically found at 
`C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Html5Viewer\`
2. Navigate to the `...\Resources\Scripts\` folder and create a new directory called `CustomScripts`


**Site Specific Installation** - For only a specific Geocortex site.

1. Locate your Geocortex HTML5 Site directory, typically found at 
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Latitude Geographics\Geocortex Essentials\Default\REST Elements\Sites\`
2. Navigate to the Site HTML5 Virtual Directory, typically found at 
`...\YourSiteName\Viewers\YourHTML5ViewerName\VirtualDirectory\`
3. In the `Resources` directory create a new directory called `CustomScripts`


**Configure Viewers for both Viewer and Site Specific Installations**

4. Copy the [`MenuComponents.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitalDataServices/GeocortexMenuComponents/master/MenuComponents.js) file into the `CustomScripts` directory
5. Next locate the `Desktop`, `Tablet`, and `Handheld` configuration files, typically located at 
`...\Resources\Config\Default\` directory.
6. Repeat the following steps for all three configuration files (`Desktop`, `Tablet`, and `Handheld`):
	1. Make a backup of the configuration file!
	2. Open the configuration file in a file editor of your choice, such as Notepad++
	3. Within the `libraries` section add the following code where the `uri` is the relative path to the `MenuComponents.js` file.

        ```
        {
          "id": "MenuComponents",
            "uri": "{ViewerConfigUri}../../Custom Scripts/MenuComponents.js",
            "locales":[
            ]
        }
        ```

    4. Within the `modules` section add the following code:
    
        ```
        {
          "moduleName": "MenuComponents",
          "moduleType": "dds.menuComponents.MenuComponentsModule",
          "libraryId": "MenuComponents",
          "configuration": {
          },
          "views": [
            {
              "id": "MenuComponentsModuleView",
              "viewModelId": "MenuComponentsModuleViewModel",
              "visible": false,
              "markup": "Modules/View/MenuComponentsModuleView.html",
              "type": "dds.menuComponents.MenuComponentsModuleView",
              "region": "TopRightMapRegion",
              "configuration": {
              }
            }
          ],
          "viewModels": [
            {
              "id": "MenuComponentsModuleViewModel",
              "type": "dds.menuComponents.MenuComponentsModuleViewModel",
              "configuration": {}
              }
          ]
        },
        ```
    4. Save the configuration file. *These modifications should be made to all relevant configuration files.*

## Usage

A Geocortex Workflow ([TestMenuWorkflow.xaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitalDataServices/GeocortexMenuComponents/master/TestMenuWorkflow.xaml)) has been provided to illustrate all of the examples below.

####"I Want to..." Menu####

**Commands**

| Command | Parameter | Parameter Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HideIWantToMenuItems` | `String[]` | `New String(){ "@language-menu-home-panel", "@language-menu-zoom-initial-extent" }` | Hides I Want To... menu items |
| `ShowIWantToMenuItems` | `String[]` | `New String(){ "@language-menu-home-panel", "@language-menu-zoom-initial-extent" }` | Shows I Want To... menu items |

**Example**

1. In the Workflow Designer, create a new string array variable (e.g. `strMenuItemArray = String[]`)
2. Assign the `String[]` with a comma-separated list of the menu item names that you want to either hide or show. *The menu item names can be found by locating the Text field that corresponds to the "I Want To..." menu item while editing that item in the Geocortex Essentials Manager.*

    ```
    //This will hide or show the "View the Home Panel" and "Return to Initial Map Extent" menu items
    strMenuItemArray = New String(){ "@language-menu-home-panel", "@language-menu-zoom-initial-extent" }
    ```

4. Next call a `RunExternalCommand` using either the `HideIWantToMenuItems` or `ShowIWantToMenuItems` as the "Command Name" with `strMenuItemArray` as the "Command Parameter".
5. The "I Want To..." menu items can be shown or hidden as needed during a Viewer session, such as based on whether a user is a Guest or in a specific Role.

####"Results" Menu####

**Commands**

| Command | Parameter | Parameter Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HideResultMenuItems` | `String[]` | `New String(){ "@language-menu-export-results-to-shp" }` | Hides Results menu items |
| `ShowResultMenuItems` | `String[]` | `New String(){ "@language-menu-export-results-to-shp" }` | Shows Results menu items |

**Example**

Follow the same steps as for hiding or showing an item from the "I Want To..." Menu (listed above) but change the Command Name and Parameters accordingly.

To find the names of the Results menu items, you will need to open on of the `Desktop`, `Tablet`, and `Handheld` configuration files, typically located in `...\Resources\Config\Default\` directory. Search for the ResultsListActions and use the "text" property within the "items" array. The default Results List Actions are:

| Default Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@language-results-toggle-table-view` | Switch to Results List to Results Table |
| `@language-menu-identify-buffered-feature-set-collection` | Shows the Buffer Options |
| `@language-menu-show-charting-view` | Shows the Charting View |
| `@language-menu-export-results-to-csv` | Exports Results List to CSV file |
| `@language-menu-export-results-to-xlsx` | Exports Results List to Microsoft Excel (xlsx) file |
| `@language-menu-export-results-to-shp` | Exports Results List to Esri Shapefile (shp) |
| `@language-menu-run-report` | Runs Report on Results List, if reports are configured |

####"Compact" Toolbar####

####"Full" Toolbar####
